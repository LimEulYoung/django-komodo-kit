#summary Brainstorm and General Outline for Features

For brevity feel free to use "DKK" (Django Komodo Kit) to indicate this project whenever writing below.

= Misc. Feature Ideas =

 * A toolbar for creating Django components: Model, Manager, Field, Form, etc.
 * Add Template Library for current project
 * Add template tag
 * New Project, New App. Ability to customize the outputs.  For example: settings customizations, include other common files like fields.py, forms.py, etc. by default.

== Templates ==

The DTL parser does not understand inheritance (via {% extends base.html %}). Therefore, it complains that the (X)HTML header is missing and, consequently, the document is not valid and well-formed. The header would be in base.html, though, for example.

== Extensions ==

= Thoughts/Questions =
  1. Need a way to bootstrap Komodo so that all DKK assets are automatically located and loaded into Komodo.
